# TextToImage
Convert any text to a image based in ASCII code

## How It Works?
First, the code convert the text into a list of ascii values, then create another list that storage every ascii value in RGB format, (every RGB value is the ASCII value). Example: 
"A" in ASCII is 65, so the RGB value is (65, 65, 65). Finally, with the list of RGB values, order the values in a 2D array like a square, and convert it in a image. 
### Example
The text input is "Hello World!", and the result is [here](github.com/Katrioska/TextToImage/blob/main/src/encTest.png?raw=true).

## Why i created this project?
Short answer: Just for Fun. Long Answer: Has been long time that i don't program, because lack of motivation. But while i was thinking about my other projects, like [Random Encryptor 2](https://github.com/Katrioska/Random_Encryptor2), i imagined how it would be to encrypt a text into a image. And is so it how I started this project.

## TO DO LIST
- [ ] Integrated command line support 
- [ ] Add support to Random Encryptor 2
